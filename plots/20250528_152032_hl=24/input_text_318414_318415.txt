[CLS] 1895 began with what became the normal trips to heligoland and then to bremerhaven , with wilhelm ii on board . this was followed by individual ship and divisional training , which was interrupted by a voyage to the northern north sea . on this trip , kurfurst friedrich wilhelm was accompanied by her sister ship brandenburg ; the two battleships stopped in lerwick in shetland from 16 to 23 march . this was the first time units of the main german fleet had left home waters . the purpose of the exercise was to test the ships in heavy weather ; both vessels performed admirably . in may , more fleet maneuvers were carried out in the western baltic , and they were concluded by a visit of the fleet to kirkwall in orkney . the squadron returned to kiel in early june , where preparations were under way for the opening of the kaiser wilhelm canal . tactical exercises were carried out in kiel bay in the presence of foreign delegations to the opening ceremony . on 28 june , an explosion occurred on one of the ship 's pinnaces killing seven crewmen and badly injuring the future vizeadmiral wilhelm starke . further training exercises lasted until 1 july , when the i division began a voyage into the atlantic ocean . this operation had political motives ; germany had only been able to send a small contingent of vessels <unk> the protected cruiser kaiserin augusta , the coastal defense ship hagen , and the sailing frigate stosch <unk> to an international naval demonstration off the moroccan coast at the same time . the main fleet could therefore provide moral support to the demonstration by steaming to spanish waters . rough weather again allowed kurfurst friedrich wilhelm and her sister ships to demonstrate their excellent seakeeping . the fleet departed vigo and stopped in queenstown , ireland . wilhelm ii , aboard his yacht hohenzollern , attended the cowes regatta while the rest of the fleet stayed off the isle of wight .[SEP]
