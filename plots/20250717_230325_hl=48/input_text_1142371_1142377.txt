[CLS] it is possible to produce exotic helium isotopes , which rapidly decay into other substances . the shortest <unk> -<unk> lived heavy helium isotope is helium <unk> -<unk> 5 with a half <unk> -<unk> life of 7 <unk> .<unk> 6 <unk> 10 <unk> 22 s . helium <unk> -<unk> 6 decays by emitting a beta particle and has a half <unk> -<unk> life of 0 <unk> .<unk> 8 second . helium <unk> -<unk> 7 also emits a beta particle as well as a gamma ray . helium <unk> -<unk> 7 and helium <unk> -<unk> 8 are created in certain nuclear reactions . helium <unk> -<unk> 6 and helium <unk> -<unk> 8 are known to exhibit a nuclear halo . = = compounds = = helium has a valence of zero and is chemically unreactive under all normal conditions . it is an electrical insulator unless ionized . as with the other noble gases , helium has metastable energy levels that allow it to remain ionized in an electrical discharge with a voltage below its ionization potential . helium can form unstable compounds , known as excimers , with tungsten , iodine , fluorine , sulfur , and phosphorus when it is subjected to a glow discharge , to electron bombardment , or reduced to plasma by other means . the molecular compounds<unk> ,<unk> , and<unk> , and the molecular ions he + 2 , he2 + 2 , heh + , and<unk> + have been created this way . heh + is also stable in its ground state , but is extremely reactive <unk> it is the strongest br<unk> nsted acid known , and therefore can exist only in isolation , as it will<unk> any molecule or<unk> it contacts . this technique has also produced the neutral molecule he2 , which has a large number of band systems , and<unk> , which is apparently held together only by polarization forces .[SEP]
